                    <h2> The Poster: </h2>
                    <div style="display: flex;">
                        <img style="width: 60%; height: 100%; margin: auto;" src="./static/drafts/Lim_Wanzhen_FBB.png">

                        <div class="posterInfo">
                            <p> Tasked to conceptualise a website design with the use of publicly available data APIs, I
                                chose to make light work
                                on designing a one-stop portal for all things food related. </p>
                            <p> Known as Food and Business Brisbane, FBB, it provides informative services and online
                                application and reporting
                                services to both consumers and providers of food respectively. </p>
                            <p> The inspiration for this website came from my difficulty understanding the nuances of
                                the food safety and consumer
                                laws dictated by the Queensland Government and Brisbane City Council. Additionally, as
                                an international student,
                                it provides information on where to find good eats in Brisbane. </p>
                            <p> In an attempt to address the above issues, I intended to create a website with its
                                central focus on informing non-locals of upcoming food events
                                and weekly markets around the city, while allowing food business owners to easily apply
                                or renew their food business licenses
                                and for consumers to make a food safety violation report easily.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            <p> okDoggy is a convenient and intuitive online map for dog owners to search and locate nearby
                                pet

                                okDoggy intends to optimise, simplify and replace the methods by which dog owners/lovers
                                find
                                dog parks.

                                okDoggy creates a swift, efficient and straightforward portal to an array of dog park
                                information.
                                Through intuitive navigation services, users are not just finding parks but discovering
                                communities where they can share unique moments and daily experiences with their beloved
                                pets.

                                The background inspiration for this website stems from dog owners who require many apps
                                for sharing their photos and acquiring resources and information for their dogs.

                            <p> Our primary target audience are dog owners. This includes those who are enthusiastic
                                about discovering new dog parks and sharing their experiences with a like-minded community.

                                Our secondary target audience is people looking to get a dog, allowing them easy access to a
                                map of all dog parks, a list of user posted images and easing their way into the world of
                                owning a dog.

                            <p> For this assignment, we worked on sketching out our low fidelity prototype by free hand

                            <p> Weeks before the MVP presentation, I told my team I was not confident in implementing a blog page in time for the MVP presentation. As the MVP presentation intended for us to present our most valuable feature of our website, I focused on getting the map functioning. Hence, in favour of delivering the promised MVP product, we scrapped the idea for having a blog page for added user interactivity. (or so I thought)</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title"> My Personal Reflection </h2>

                    <div style="display: flex;">
                        <div style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left">
                            <p> Many tensions arose within our group after this sprint. One of my teammate decided by himself we needed a blog page. He was insistent on it having implemented. His intentions and ideas for it are not very well-founded. I advised that it was unrealistic in the delivery time considering the number of functionalities we wanted versus the limited time resource and knowledge of all parties. He decided however, on his own accord, to work on a blog page and utilise his website design from one of his assignments in DECO1400.</p>
                            <p> The MVP product and functionalities presented has been 100% my doing, while my other teammates worked on the slides. </p>
                            <p> Ying, who was usually on top of things, had some minor disagreements when working with our other teammate. He had insisted that certain criteria or points to address in the presentation were not needed. 
                            While my other teammate and I had been in the past studio sessions where we had been previously instructed numerous times that the presentation should focus on these few points, these same points, in the end were left out of the presentation by the discretion of our other teammate.
                            Being left out in the making of the presentation, it is my biggest regret I did not oversee the quality and maintained the high standard I had envisioned for this project and myself.

                            <p> At the end of the day, I provided unparalleled utility to my team, and the outcome presented would not have had nearly the same value had I not been involved. </p>
                            <p> It was a long arduous journey to get the MVP product to a level I was satisfied and proud of. I worked tirelessly on end to understand how the UQZone environment and deliberated a long time if I should have spared myself the trouble of hosting a NodeJS server to handle website routing and GET/POST methods of user data. </p>
                            <p> The Google Maps JS API and Brisbane City Council dog off-leash API calls added up to a total of 2 API calls, which was enough to fulfil the assignment criteria. These were easily done with JS files. </p>
                            <p> However, to add the user interactivity with the MVP product, I needed to know and learn how to handle user uploaded files. This caused me to spend alot of time researching the best way to do it. I landed with the idea of hosting a NodeJS server.</p>
                            <p> A very special thanks and shoutout to Li from EAIT Helpdesk who entertained my questions and addressed some issues I was facing when setting up the website in the UQZone. </p>
                            <div style="display: flex;">

                            </div>
                            <p> I took a long time of refining and polishing the NodeJS application in my local environment, even setting up the website on my own UQZone to ensure it ran and compiled successfully. Once I was confident enough that it would run with the GET/POST methods, I pitched it to my team. 
                                Just in case things go awry, I had one of my teammates keep the original states of the website (serving static pages on htdocs) while I changed the team zone to host the NodeJS server.</p>
                            <p> The website works with some success. The infowindow was not displaying the updated and correct design. Despite pushing the updated and correct file responsible for the infowindow design, it was never updated correctly. This however, worked in my own UQZone website. I was very certain that the files in the team zone and my own UQZone were identical. </p>
                            <p> This project was a good lesson in humility. Many problems I had faced would have been easily resolved/clarified had I not been stubborn in accepting help. My DECO1800 tutors (yes, you!) and the EAIT Helpdesk staff are the indispensable resources to me producing the very look and functionality of the website you see. </p>
                            <p> I am still in the process of learning when to say 'No' and be more tolerant to my teammates. I admit that I have not been transparent with the tutors as I was reluctant to discuss about the shortfalls of one of our team members before the week leading up to the presentation. The original impression of a cohesive and happy team would have been destroyed, so I thought. 
                                Getting the job done was however more important, and putting up with his shenanigans was frustrating and mentally draining, ultimately affecting my performance and severe lack of sleep. </p>
